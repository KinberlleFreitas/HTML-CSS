        <h1>The Amazing Web Middleware</h1>
        <h2>A Free Windows API/SDK System to Easily Manage Data</h2>
        <p>Web Middleware is used to
            Power Any MS Windows PC App
            Coded in Any Development Language
            To manage & process any Web Databases
            And Local MS Jet powered Databases as well.</p>
            <p>Web Middleware is a silent data conduit between
                Windows Programs & Datawise Web Pages
                Which essentially only contain "coding"
                Without Any Presentation Output.</p>
                <h2>There's a Lot More!</h2>
                <p>It also includes a nice range of SDK Functions.
                    There's NO Windows Registration needed
                    And it does not install OCXs or DLLs</p>
                    <p>Installing Web Middleware is easy as pie...
                        Simply place WebMiddleware.exe into
                        the same folder as your program !!
                        No Windows Registry Changes</p>
                        <h2>You cannot use a Smartphone for everything</h2>
                        <p>WRITING DESKTOP APPLICATIONS TO MANAGE
                            DATA IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONLY A REAL
                            COMPUTER IS GOOD ENOUGH TO REALLY
                            BE EFFECTIVE IN DATA MANAGEMENT</p>
                            <p>Here's another really cool feature.
                                Even w/out the MS CommonDialog OCX,
                                you can invoke the Windows File Picker Dialog
                                and retrieve a desired file name via Web Middleware
                                
                                Uses ONLY the EXISTING Windows distributed components</p>
